##SQL Interview Question

# 1. What is SQL? 
SQL is a standard database language used for accessing and manipulating data in databases. It stands for Structured Query Language and was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries, SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.

# 2. What is a database?
A Database is defined as a structured form of data storage in a computer or a collection of data in an organized manner and can be accessed in various ways. The Database Management System allows a user to interact with the database.

# 3. Does SQL support programming language features?
It is true that SQL is a language, but it does not support programming as it is not a programming language, it is a command language.

# 4. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 datatype in SQL?
Both of these data types are used for characters, but varchar2 is used for character strings of variable length, whereas char is used for character strings of fixed length. For example, if we specify the type as char(5) then we will not be allowed to store a string of any other length in this variable, but if we specify the type of this variable as varchar2(5) then we will be allowed to store strings of variable length. We can store a string of length 3 or 4 or 2 in this variable.

# 5. What do you mean by data definition language? 
Data definition language or DDL allows to execution of queries like CREATE, DROP, and ALTER. That is those queries that define the data.
